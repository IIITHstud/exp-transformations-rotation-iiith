## Experiment Procedure

1. **Introduction to Rotation Transformation:**
   - This experiment introduces the concept of the [rotation transformation](#).

2. **Interactive Point Rotation:**
   - A point is selected for the rotation transformation.
   - Utilize the slider located at the bottom of the interface to [watch the rotation](#) of the point about the origin.

3. **Node Representation of Transformation:**
   - The experiment incorporates a visual representation through a tree structure.
   - A node within the tree corresponds to the transformation applied to the point, showing the rotation axis and the angle of rotation.
   - Move the slider to animate the transformation between the starting and ending points.

4. **Matrix Representation (R):**
   - The rotation matrix (R) responsible for the transformation is displayed.
   - Participants can actively engage by editing the rotation parameters, observing how the matrix dynamically adjusts.

5. **Interpretations of Rotation:**
   - Switch between two interpretations of rotation at any time by checking the [Transform co-ordinate systems checkbox](#) under the Display tab.
   - Compare how rotation works in both cases: rotation of a point with respect to the coordinate axes and the rotation of the coordinate axes with respect to the point.

6. **Three-Dimensional Rotation:**
   - For rotations along specific axes, switch to a 3-dimensional world by checking the [3D checkbox](#) under the Display tab.
   - Drag with the right mouse button to rotate the entire world, offering a more dynamic perspective.

By following these steps, participants will gain hands-on experience in applying rotation transformations, understanding the associated matrix operations, and exploring the nuances of interpreting rotations in different coordinate systems.
