The aim of this experiment is to delve into the fundamental concept of rotation as a transformative operation in geometry and linear algebra. Participants will explore how rotation functions as a transformation that describes the motion of a rigid body around a fixed point in a plane or in space. Unlike translations, which lack fixed points, rotations preserve distances between any two points in what is known as an isometric transformation. This experiment aims to provide participants with a practical understanding of rotation and its distinctive characteristics within the realm of geometric transformations.
